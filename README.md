## Intro ##

This app is designed to help Braintree merchants test and integrate the Venmo SDK. Developers will be able to add a payment method (e.g. credit or debit card) in this application in the Sandbox environment, then see the card appear in their merchant app. Developers can also add a card, then tap "Refresh" to see the card appear in the testing app.

## Libraries ##

This application uses [FSNetworking](https://github.com/foursquare/FSNetworking) for iOS networking.
